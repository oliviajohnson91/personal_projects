#SHA-1
The directory titled "SHA-1" houses my SHA-1 implementation. I implemented the SHA-1 algorithm in Python as well as a program to time the algorithm. I timed 500 random strings of varying lengths and graphed their averages to show the asymptotic runtime. This was my first project in Python and I enjoyed the learning process very much.
